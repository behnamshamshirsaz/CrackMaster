# CrackMaster
x86/x64 Ring 0/-2 System Freezer/Debugger

History

Crack Master started as a personal research project in 1993. Its first full version (v0.12.10) had a 8086 disassembler and multi triggering methods (NMI,RTC,Timer and DOS/BIOS) Interrupts and a complete Save/Restore/Freeze File system for Memory and CPU, just like Amiga Action Replay III (On Commodore Amiga Computers). The only limitation was that freezing was not possible while the CPU was in protected mode. After developing ISDA 32 Bits O.S. (Another personal research project aimed to developing a new 32 Bits Protected Mode O.S. in pure x86 Assembly - 1994) Second release of Crack Master was born. It had a complete chipset memory control library support for hiding it’s code and needed buffers inside RAM regions that are not used by O.S. and BIOS. It’s code rewritten to support i386 protected mode and using new O.S. libraries. Since 1995 and extensive use of Windows 95 and beyond, It should be rewritten as a VXD driver to maintain its capabilities under Windows but due to rapid changing of Windows Internals and personal life situation Crack Master project stopped. Now after near 30 years since its first release, It comes again [Release 3] as a complete Freezing system for SMM/Real/Protected Mode versions and supports needed triggering mechanisms. SMM trigger base version is only available by customer request and is more suitable for cyber security agencies and/or governmental organizations (Due to its nature and the fact that it should be configured and partly recode on specific needed hardware).

System Requirements
